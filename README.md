## VapoDataBus
VapoDataBus was created to purge NServiceBus DataBus files after n days.  With some small modifications it can be used to purge other files as well. 

We originaly used Sam Martindale's Powershell script for purging, but we found that we needed something that handled a larger volume of files.

This project improves on Sam's PS script in the following ways:
- It can be run once an hour to delete an hour of files at a time
- Uses .NET and is slightly faster at deleting files than PS
- Is installed as a windows service with Quartz.Net scheduling

Sam, Thanks for publishing your PowerShell script.  It was a lifesaver when I found it and it inspired this project.

### Configuration
The configuration is all in the app settings.  For the most part you will only need to change the path to your DataBus share.

- Cron := This is a standard Cron Expression set to run every hour
- FolderPath := Set to the path to your DataBus share.
- FolderDatePatter := This is a Regex that parses the DataBus folder names into a datetime
- NumberOfDays =: The max number of days you want to keep files.

Important note on NumberOfDays: 
This is based on 24 hours so that it deletes files every hour.  If you set the number of days to 1 as an example, it will delete any folders over 24hours old.

```sh
  <appSettings>
    <add key="Cron" value="0 0 0/1 * * ?" /> <!--Set to run every hour -->
    <add key="FolderPath" value="C:\data\temp\DataBus" /> 
    <add key="FolderDatePattern"
    value="^(?&lt;year>\d{4})\-(?&lt;month>\d{2})\-(?&lt;day>\d{1,2})_(?&lt;hour>\d{1,2})" />
    <add key="NumberOfDays" value="3" />
  </appSettings>
```

### Installation

This project uses TopShelf and can be installed as a windows service by executing the following commandline after you pull the project down and compile it:
